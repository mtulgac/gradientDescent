# gradientDescent
Implementing Mini-Batch Gradient Descent without using Scikit-Learning library

In order to run it:

Just type python3 hw1.py 

As long as the model and data file is on the same directory, it should run without any problem.

P.S. I initialized the parameters randomly. You can change them inside the code.
